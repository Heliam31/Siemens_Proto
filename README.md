# Siemens_Proto  
This repository is made to decode and encode specifically Siemens Protobuf messages, from the IAQ multisensor.  

## Usage  
There are two folders:  
* ```SiemensDecode``` is a "clean" code, that decodes a protobuf encoded message, and formats it if it's a measurement message.  
    * ```tests.py``` is the code to be launched
* ```Siemens-Proto``` is a bunch of various codes that uses protobuf to decode, encode message and processes them
    *
